It gives you a wide colour gamut and a high refresh rate for an ultra-clear gaming experience, so you can surround yourself with an exciting and immersive gaming and entertainment experience. The ultra-wide panoramic view lets you assess the entire landscape at a glance to give you the advantage. The ultra-high-definition 3440 × 1440 resolution reveals exquisitely realistic detail in every corner of the scene, bringing spectacular game worlds to life. With brightness up to 300 nits and a high 3000:1 contrast ratio, the monitor displays clear, vivid beautiful images from blinding white to midnight black. The 1500R extreme curvature design feels like being surrounded by the screen, giving you an immersive panoramic view. The curved screen creates a smaller visual inclination angle, so that every point on the screen is almost equally distant from your eyes, reducing visual distortion and giving you a more realistic view of every corner. The high 144 Hz refresh rate and 4 ms response time effectively reduce stutter and ghosting in games. In shooting games that require quick reactions, this makes it easier to accurately lock onto and hit your target when speed is the key to winnin",
